# AviationQuiz
 
This is a webapp that does quizzing for several aviation things. Currently supported are:

Airport Codes
METAR Decoding
TAF Decoding (coming soon)
Winds Aloft decoding (coming soon)

Thank you to ChatGPT for the question banks (used so I didn't have to generate the datasets by hand). Questions and answers have been checked to be accurate.
